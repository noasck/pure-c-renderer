# Pure C renderer. CPU ONLY

What is this all about? displaying 3d geometry using only CPU (bc computers are faster than you think)

I don't bother myself with window resizing, buffering, any meaning or good taste things; just trying to make it work as fast as I can on Intel i3-7100U (4) @ 2.400GHz.


Let's see if we can beat `tinygl:_)`

### Current state:

Nuklear UI + 2 free models, no texturing.
